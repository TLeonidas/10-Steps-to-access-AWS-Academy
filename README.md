# 10 Steps to Access AWS Academy & Perform Labs in JupyterLab with SageMaker

### Target Audience: Students enrolled in AWS Academy courses.

In my second semester using AWS Academy at HCC, I noticed that over 20% of my colleagues struggled to access their accounts and launch labs for assignments. This not only caused frustration but also potentially hindered their learning progress.

To address this, I created a simple and interactive JupyterLab notebook that guides students through the entire process, from accessing AWS Academy to launching labs using Amazon SageMaker. With clear instructions, screenshots, and helpful tips, my notebook saves students time, reduces frustration, and ensures they can focus on the hands-on learning experience.

### Objectives:

Access and navigate AWS Academy.
Launch a lab within JupyterLab using SageMaker.
Complete lab exercises and gain practical cloud experience.

### Prerequisites:

AWS Academy Account
Google Chrome or Firefox (Recommended browsers for seamless integration.)
Basic Computer Skills

Python familiarity: Enhances the JupyterLab experience for some labs. (Optional)

### Contributions Welcome!

You can contribute by adding those handy links from the glossary to each corresponding step within the notebook. This will make it easier for learners to quickly navigate to specific sections and ensure a seamless learning flow. Feel free to come up with any other improvements.
